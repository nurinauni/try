<h7 align="center">Hi my name is Nurin Auni Habriyah bt Norulhisam</h7>
<p align="justify">I was born in Putrajaya on 1st April 2004.I am the eldest and my sister is nine years younger .I was raise in a city so most people would assume that I'm a spoiled brat. My parents have stricly raise me to behave my self and adapt in any type of situation. So as a result when I first arrived in a quite small town I did survived. You might think that I'm exaggerating things but during my stays here I hear alot and i mean alot of complain on how hot this place is compared to where they lived  and not to downgrading them but the place the person that complain the most are actually no difrent. To be honest i dont think that I were explaining about my self but more to chaterring random things because by the time I'm writhing this I was already half asleep .So to get to know me more please scroll down more. Just to be sure I'll be continue to write this once I woke up. </p>
<p align="justify"> Hi again its me , so back to the toppic i will start with introducing my self , my name is Nurin Auni Habriyah and you can call me anyting . i was born in putrajaya on 1st April 2004 . I have a lil sister that 9 years younger then me . My parents had been maried for about 21 years.Both my parents are a first born so technically I have no older cousins . Im close to my uncles and aunties and the main reason is because we just 5 to 6 years. my personality are not that complicatedas you may know Im an introvert but I do act what they would say "NORMAL" with those that Im good with. To be honest I hate to acting nice and all to others , like we can actually act like we dont know each other and work in group like usual . Or we dont really have to exposing our life and the other people should just continue living their llife without getting into other life because its not as if we're gonna keep  in contact . 
<p align="justify"> Moving on fron that i dont think i have alot to say here as we will get to know each other more on next page so thats all and im gonna end here bye </p>
